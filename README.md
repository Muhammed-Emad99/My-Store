## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
  npm install my-project
  cd my-project
```

#### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bryanforbes/intern-angular
cd intern-angular
```

#### Install npm packages

Install the ` npm ` packages described in the ` package.json ` and verify that it works:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
The ` npm start ` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into ` dist/, ` watches for changes to the source files, and runs ` lite-server ` on port `3000`.

Shut it down manually with ` Ctrl-C `.

#### npm scripts
These are the most useful commands defined in ` package.json `:

- ` npm start` - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
- ` npm run build` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
- ` npm run build` :watch - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier in "watch mode"; when changes occur to source files, they will be recompiled or copied into `dist/`.
- ` npm run lint` - runs `tslint` on the project files.
- ` npm run serve` - runs `lite-server`.
These are the test-related scripts:

- ` npm test` - builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
- ` npm run ci` - cleans, lints, and builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
